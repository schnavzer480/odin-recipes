    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Marinade for Grilled Pork</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, mix thinly sliced pork collar or pork shoulder with minced garlic, soy sauce, oyster sauce, sugar, white pepper, and a dash of sesame oil.</li>
        <li>Ensure the pork slices are well coated with the marinade, then cover the bowl and let it marinate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to infuse.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Dipping Sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a separate bowl, prepare the dipping sauce by combining lime juice, fish sauce, finely chopped Thai bird chilies, minced garlic, and sugar. Adjust the quantities to achieve a balanced sweet, sour, salty, and spicy flavor.</li>
        <li>Stir the sauce until the sugar is dissolved, and set it aside.</li>
    </ol>    
    <h3>Grilling</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a grill or grill pan over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Grill the marinated pork slices until they are cooked through and develop a nice char on the edges. This usually takes about 2-3 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Once grilled, remove the pork from the heat.</li>
    </ol>    
    <h3>Serving</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Arrange the grilled pork slices on a serving platter.</li>
        <li>Drizzle some of the dipping sauce over the pork or serve the sauce on the side.</li>
        <li>Optionally, garnish with fresh chopped cilantro.</li>
    </ol>
